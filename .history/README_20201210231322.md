# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Your Task

You'll need to use a library like [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to work with dates and times. `Moment.js` has historically been the most popular date/time library but is no longer supported by its developers. However, you can still use it for this project, or you can look into one of the following alternatives:

  * [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/)

  * [Day.js](https://day.js.org/)

  * [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/)

  * [js-Joda](https://js-joda.github.io/js-joda/)

Whichever library you choose, be sure to read the documentation carefully!
